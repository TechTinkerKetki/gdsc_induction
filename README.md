About the project:
This is a Content-Based Song Recommendation System built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The system suggests songs similar to the userâ€™s input based on features like artist, genre, tempo, and more. It also includes fuzzy matching for handling incorrect song names.

Dataset:
The dataset is a zip of spotify songs taken from kaggle.

How to use:
Enter the name of the song in the input field.
Any spelling mistakes will be autocorrected using fuzzy matching.
The model will recommend similar songs and the UI will display it along with the name of the artist.

Future improvements;
Incorporate collaborative filtering for better results.
integrate deep learning
